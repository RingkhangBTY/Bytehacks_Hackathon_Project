                <h3>Ayush</h3>
                <p>Hello everyone, I’m Ayush. I grew up in a middle-class family where I didn’t receive much encouragement for my passion for art, as my parents had envisioned me becoming an engineer—a dream that’s quite common in Indian families, where becoming a doctor or an engineer is often seen as the ultimate goal. They believed that pursuing painting wouldn’t lead to success. But here I am today, standing before you, thriving in my art, all thanks to your unwavering love and support. It’s because of you that I’ve been able to follow my passion and make it my reality.
                Thank You Everyone!</p>

                <p>I've always been fascinated by how a single block of stone can be chiseled and sculpted into something so powerful that even the most stoic person can appreciate its beauty. Every time I sculpt, I feel more alive than with anything else. In 2018, I moved to Mumbai to attend art school, where I dedicated myself to refining my skills through years of hard work and perseverance. Today, my efforts are finally paying off, as my life-sized sculptures—capturing the essence of human emotion and strength—are starting to gain recognition and connect with people in meaningful ways.</p>

                <p>I began my journey in the world of handmade crafts since I was a child, where I found joy and peace by creating small and cute toys, bracelets, etc., I often spend most of my childhood experimenting with fabrics, wood and things I could found in my house. In 2015 I moved to a different city to complete my degree while honing my skills in handcrafts like , hand dying fabrics, weaving, and leatherwork ,etc., After graduation I opened a shop where I started selling my handmade creations which is thriving now thanks to the people who supported me in my struggle days…….Thank you everyone.</p>
